# Superhero-Sightings
My final project during my Java training at mThree.

A full stack spring boot web application that allows people to document recent superhero sightings through RESTful requests. The applications allows the user to create, read, update and delete information pertaining to superhero sightings. This application follows a MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. 

# Tools & Technologies Used
